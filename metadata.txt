description=Transportation modeling toolbox for QGIS
about=AequilibraE is a transportation modelling toolbox modeled after the standard 4-step modeling process and according to the current state of the practice in transportation modeling. It includes procedures for the following activities--> NETWORK MANIPULATION: creation of node layers from line layers, automatic addition of centroid connectors, --> PATH COMPUTATION: computation and display of shortest paths, computation of impedance matrices and traffic assignment, --> TRIP DISTRIBUTION: Iterative proportional fitting (IPF), and calibration and application of synthetic gravity models, --> GIS SUPPORT: Computation of desire lines and delaunay lines, polygon overlay, GeoTag (spatial join without creating a third joined layer) and creation of stacked bandwidth maps & scenario comparison tool -->All non-GIS features (assignment, path computation and trip distribution) can be accessed directly from a Python shell.
