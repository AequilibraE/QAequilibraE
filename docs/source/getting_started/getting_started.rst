Getting Started
===============

In this section we describe how you can install AequilibraE's QGIS plug-in.

.. note::

    The recommendations on this page are as current as of May 2023.

Installation
------------

AequilibraE is available from the QGIS plugin repository, and we recommend you
download it using the instructions below.

Step--by-step installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The steps for installing AequilibraE are the same as for any QGIS plugin

    :alt: Third step

.. note::
   We recommend selecting experimental plugins ONLY if you absolutely require
   the latest features. Otherwise keep it with the latest stable one.
   The old plugin (aequilibrae) has been deprecated and may eventually stop working
   altogether.

After installing the plugin, you will be faced with the question of whether you
want to download its dependencies, which are required for using most of the
features. The problem is that many of AequilibraE's algorithms rely on compiled
extensions, but it is against the QGIS's community guidelines to upload binaries
to the repository.

If you select to download the packages, QGIS will freeze for a few seconds before
showing the image below.
