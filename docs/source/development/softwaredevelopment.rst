Contributing to AequilibraE for QGIS
====================================

This page presents some initial instructions on how to setup your system to start contributing to QAequilibraE 
and lists the requirements for all pull-requests to be merged into main.

Software Design and requirements
--------------------------------

QAequilibraE is built on top of AequilibraE's main features, and the most important piece of AequilibraE's backend 
is, without a doubt, `NumPy <http://numpy.org>`_.

The user might not see or know, but whenever vectorization is not possible through the use of NumPy functions, 
compiled code written in `Cython <https://cython.org/>`_ is developed in order to accelerate computation.

QAequilibraE also observes a strong requirement of only using libraries that are available in the Python installation
used by `QGIS <https://qgis.org/en/site/>`_ on Windows.

We have not yet found an ideal source of recommendations for developing QAequilibraE, but a good initial take can be
found in `this article <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745>`_.

Please notice that QAequilibraE installation MUST WORK at least in the most recent long-term release (LTR).

Development Install
-------------------

We recommend using a dedicated virtual environment to develop QAequilibraE, using the version of Python related 
to the most recent QGIS long-term release. When this section was updated (November/2024), LTR 3.34.12 was coming
with a default 3.12.7 Python environment.

We also assume you are using one of `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm>`_ or 
`VSCode <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_, which are good IDEs for Python. If you are using a different IDE, 
we would welcome if you could contribute with instructions to set that up.

(For us,) The easiest way of developing a QGIS plugin is using a Docker container to build an image containing
a QGIS installation. When cloning QAequilibraE repository into your local machine you will find a ``Dockerfile`` 
with this recipe. ::

  git clone https://github.com/AequilibraE/qaequilibrae.git

Then all you have to do is create a virtual environment, and proceed with the requirements' installation.
We understood that the creation of a virtual development environment within a container would be redundant, 
however after facing some developing issues related to `PEP 668 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/>`_, we believe
that using a virtual environment would be a good practice. ::

  python3 -m venv .venv --system-site-package
  . .venv/bin/activate
  python3 -m pip install - U pip setuptools uv
  python3 -m pip install -r test/requirements_test.txt
  python3 ./ci/dependency_installation.py
  export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/qaequilibrae/packages:$PYTHONPATH
  export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen

Development Guidelines
-----------------------

QAequilibraE development (tries) to follow a few standards. A huge effort is being undertaken by the development
team to update several portions of the code are still not up to such standards.

Style
~~~~~~

* Python code should follow (mostly) the `pycodestyle style guide <https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_.
* Python docstrings should follow the `reStructuredText Docstring Format <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0287/>`_.
* We are big fans of auto-code formatting. For that, we use `Black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.
* Negating some of what we have said so far, we use maximum line length of 120 characters.

Imports
~~~~~~~

* Imports should be one per line.
* Imports should be grouped into standard library, third-party, and intra-library imports. 
* Imports of NumPy should follow the following convention:

::

    import numpy as np

Translatable Strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are adding or modifying any piece of QAequilibraE's code that includes translatable strings, which are the
strings displayed in the widget windows, please ensure you use the ``tr`` function to locate the strings. This will 
guarantee that the strings are included in our future translations. Currently, only classes that have a ``self`` method 
support the localization of strings.

::

    # Indicates that the message "You need at least three centroids to route. " will be
    # set for translation.
    qgis.utils.iface.messageBar().pushMessage(self.tr("You need at least three centroids to route. "), "", level=3)

    # In case you have to insert any text into a string, the best way is to use string format
    self.error = self.tr("ID {} is non unique in your selected field").format(str(id))

Strings in QAequilibraE Processing Provider can also be translated. To indicate the strings, import the translation
function and configure it to return the context and the message.

::
  
   from qaequilibrae.i18n.translate import trlt

   class YourClassHere():
      ...
      # YourClassHere functions
      ...
      def processAlgorithm(self, parameters, context, model_feedback):
        ...
        feedback.pushInfo(self.tr("Running assignment"))  # indicates the translatable string
        ...

      def tr(self, message):
        return trlt("TrafficAssignYAML", message)

As for November 2024, QAequilibraE's translations are all hosted in 
`Transifex <https://explore.transifex.com/aequilibrae/qaequilibrae/>`_. Currently, we are targeting translations
in Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. If you want to contribute to QAequilibraE 
by translating the plugin to other languages or reviewing the existing translations, please let us know in our 
`AequilibraE Google Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/aequilibrae>`_,
so we can add your language to our translation pool!

In the :ref:`plugin internationalization <plugin_i18n>` page, you can find more information on creating your account and
start translating QAequilibraE.

Contributing to AequilibraE for QGIS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GitHub has a nice visual explanation on how collaboration is done `GitHub Flow
<https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow>`_. (For us,) The most important points there are:

* The main branch contains the latest working/release version of QAequilibraE
* Work is done in an issue/feature branch (or a fork) and then pushed to a new branch
* Automated testing is run using Github Actions. All tests must pass:

  * Unit testing
  * Build/packaging tests
  * Documentation building test

* If the tests pass, then a manual pull request can be approved to merge into main
* The main branch is protected and therefore can only be written to after the code has been reviewed and approved
* No individual has the privileges to push to the main branch

Release versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

QAequilibraE uses the de-facto Python standard for `versioning
<http://the-hitchhikers-guide-to-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specification.html>`_

::

  MAJOR.MINOR[.MICRO]

- MAJOR designates a major revision number for the software. Usually, raising a major revision number means that
  you are adding a lot of features, breaking backward-compatibility or drastically changing the API.

- MINOR usually groups moderate changes to the software like bug fixes or minor improvements. Most of the time, end \
  users can upgrade with no risks their software to a new minor release. In case an API changes, the end users will be \
  notified with deprecation warnings. In other words, API stability is usually a promise between two minor releases.

- Some software use a third level: MICRO. This level is used when the release cycle of minor release is quite long.
  In that case, micro releases are dedicated to bug fixes.

QAequilibraE's development is happening mostly within the Minor and Micro levels.

Testing
~~~~~~~~

QAequilibraE testing is done with some tools:

* `Black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, the uncompromising code formatter
* `pytest <http://pytest.org/latest/>`_, a Python testing tool
* `pytest-cov <https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_, a tool for measuring test code coverage
* `pytest-qt <https://pytest-qt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_, a tool for testing PyQt5 applications
* `pytest-qgis <https://pypi.org/project/pytest-qgis/>`_, a tool for writing QGIS tests

To run the tests locally, you will need to figure out what to do...

These same tests are run by GitHub Actions with each push to the repository. These tests need to pass in order to 
somebody manually review the code before merging it into main (or returning for corrections).

In some cases, test targets need to be updated to match the new results produced by the code since these 
are now the correct results. In order to update the test targets, first determine which tests are 
failing and then review the failing lines in the source files. These are easy to identify since each 
test ultimately comes down to one of Python's various types of ``assert`` statements. Once you identify 
which ``assert`` is failing, you can work your way back through the code that creates the test targets in 
order to update it. After updating the test targets, re-run the tests to confirm the new code passes all 
the tests.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the QAequilibraE documentation is (unfortunately) written in `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ and built with `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_.
Although reStructuredText is often unnecessarily convoluted to write, Sphinx is capable of converting it to 
standard-looking HTML pages, while also bringing the docstring documentation along for the ride.

To build the documentation, first make sure the required packages are installed::

    pip install sphinx pydata-sphinx-theme sphinx-design sphinx-panels sphinx-subfigure

Next, build the documentation in HTML format with the following commands run from the ``root`` folder::

    cd docs
    make html

Finally
~~~~~~~

A LOT of the structure around the documentation was borrowed (copied) from the excellent project `ActivitySim
<https://activitysim.github.io/>`_.
