Menus in Detail
===============

In this section you can find a deep dive into modeling with AequilibraE, as
a start guide to a complete view into AequilibraE's data structure. Each and 
every one of the following sub-sections are related to one AequilibraE's
main functionalities.

Most screenshots in this section are related to Sioux Falls, a standard example
in transportation network algorithm studies. 

In the following sections, we present an illustrated example of a realistic modeling workflow
for the beginner modeler out there. You can easily create a Sioux Falls model using our
:ref:`create example <create_example>` tool. The remaining of the data used
in the examples can be downloaded `here <https://www.aequilibrae.com/data/SiouxFalls.7z>`_.

As to not upset those who think that Sioux Falls is not a realistic example (you
would be right to think so), the example data is also available for the `Chicago
regional model <https://www.aequilibrae.com/data/Chicago.7z>`_,
which has nearly 40,000 links and almost 1,800 zones.

Got a bigger instance we could use as an example? Send it over!
