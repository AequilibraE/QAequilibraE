AequilibraE
===========

AequilibraE is the first comprehensive Python package for transportation
modeling, and it aims to provide all the resources not easily available from
other open-source packages in the Python ecosystem or for any Open-Source GIS
package.

If you still need to install AequilibraE, then go to the
`installation instructions <installation.html>`__

If you have already installed AequilibraE, but you are are somewhat puzzled by
its menus and interfaces (or if you are just starting in the world of
transportation modelling) then the best place to start is with our series of
tutorials for end to end transportation modelling (still being produced).

Quick Tour
----------
AequilibraE 0.6 for QGIS has brought substantial changes to the previous graphical
interface, which might cause some confusion to old users. For a brief overview
of the new interface, we have prepared a little video tour.
