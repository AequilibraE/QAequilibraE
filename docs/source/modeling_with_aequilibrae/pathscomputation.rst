Path computation
================

From version 0.6, AequilibraE plug-in does not require the user to create the graph to perform
path computation as in previous versions. In this version, as you set up your own configurations,
the software already computes the graph for you.

You can check how to create an impedance (skim) matrix with AequilibraE at the 
:ref:`skmming <siouxfalls-skimming>` 
section at the Sioux Falls example page.

You can check an application of traffic assignment in the
:ref:`traffic assignment with skimming <siouxfalls-traffic-assignment-and-skimming>`
