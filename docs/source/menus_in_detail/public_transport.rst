Public Transport
================

QAequilibraE is capable of importing a General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) feed 
into its public transport database. More details on the **public_transport.sqlite** are discussed on a nearly 
*per-table* basis in `AequilibraE's documentation <https://www.aequilibrae.com/python/latest/modeling_with_aequilibrae/transit_database/data_model/datamodel.html>`_, 
and we recommend understanding the role of each table before 
setting an AequilibraE model you intend to use. If you don't know much about GTFS, we strongly encourage you to take
a look at the documentation provived by `Google <https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs>`_.
