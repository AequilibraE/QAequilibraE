Tutorials and Sample data
=========================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

It is not our intention here to provide a transportation modeling course, so the
material listed below assumes that you are somewhat familiar with traditional
transport modeling.

For an example workflow, check the comprehensive example we prepared for
:ref:`sioux_falls`.

Several portions of that work flow have also been reproduced in Python.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

We have compiled two very distinct example datasets imported from the
`TNTP instances <https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks/>`_.

* `Sioux Falls <https://www.aequilibrae.com/data/SiouxFalls.7z>`_
* `Chicago Regional <https://www.aequilibrae.com/data/Chicago.7z>`_

While the Sioux Falls network is probably the most traditional example network
available for evaluating network algorithms, the Chicago Regional model is a
good example of a real-world sized model, with roughly 1,800 zones.

Each instance contains the network in pure GIS format (GeoPackage), the
AequilibraE project already imported, the demand matrix in both AEM and OMX
formats and the best-known solutions for link flows.

Video Tutorials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Preparing tutorials using screen recording software is a LOT easier than writing
comprehensive written documentation, so we have amassed a substantial collection
of video tutorials hosted on YouTube.
