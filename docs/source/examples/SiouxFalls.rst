Sioux Falls
===========

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

Sioux Falls has long been used as the standard example in transportation
network algorithm studies, and who are we to break that tradition?

Here we present an image-based example on a realistic modelling workflow
for the beginner modeler out there. All the data used here can be downloaded
at the :ref:`tutorial_sample_data` page.

As to not upset those who think that Sioux Falls is not a realistic example (you
would be right to think so), the example data is also available for the Chicago
regional model, which has nearly 40,000 links and almost 1,800 zones.

Got a bigger instance we could use as an example? Send it over!

Creating a project
-------------------

If all you have to start your project are the layers and matrices (or the demand
model) from your original model, then we can import it into AequilibraE. Just
make sure that you followed the layer preparation instructions on
:ref:`network_preparation`.

The project creation resource lives under the project menu.
