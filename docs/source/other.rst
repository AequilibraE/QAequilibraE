Global parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parameters file is part of the AequilibraE package for Python, so all the
reference documentation for this section can be found in its
`documentation page <http://www.aequilibrae.com/python/V.0.6.1/parameter_file.html>`_.

The QGIS plugin, however, has a nice interface to view and edit the parameters
file, which can be accessed through **Aequilibrae > Parameters**. This
interface, depicted below, allows one to edit and validate parameters before
submitting them as the new parameter file for all AequilibraE procedures.
