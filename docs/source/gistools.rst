Desire Lines
-----------------

AequilibraE is now capable of doing two types of desire lines


If you ar enew to AequilibraE and are trying use this tool for the first time, we recommend you first take a look at
the section on * `importing matrices into AequilibraE format <data.html>`__. In our experience, that is where most
people find themselves stranded.
